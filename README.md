# Moving-Square-Game
This is a simple game, where the user needs to move the red square such that it does not collide with the moving obstacles. This is made in JavaScript.
The file functions.js handles the logic and helps in showing the game on the canvas graphically. It basically has one prominent function called updateArea(), which is called after every 20 milliseconds, which helps in validating the movements of obstacles and the square.
